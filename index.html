        <h3>Learning to Code</h3>
        <p>I'm learning front and back end development to further my career and
            to help out my peers in one of my favorite industires I've worked in
            --tourism and history. I've been a professional tour guide in Chicago
            since 2011 and have researched, written, and led dozens of tours all
            over the city. While I love research, there are some limitations to 		it,
            and my goal is to be able to make accessing historical records easier
            and to create interfaces with which the general public can both find
            and record their own histories. <strong> This will turn into a card that links you to lower on the page.</strong></strong></p>

        <h3>Chicago Address Conversion Site</h3>
        <p>The first way I'm looking to do this is by creating a database of the
            address conversions that happened in Chicago in 1909. That year, the
            entire city went from its previous addresses to the
            order we're familliar with today. If you want to figure out the old
            address of a building, you have to hunt through a PDF scan of
            a book from 1909 listing every street and its new/old address. My first
            project as a developer is to create a website in which researchers like
            myself can simply enter in the new (or old) address to find its
            partner without having to scan through an old PDF.</p>
         <p>It's a simple idea that requires a lot of data entry, but with fellow
            historians to help enter addresses, it'll be a site that ultimately
            saves time for researchers and allows easier access for casual historians
            to look up the history of a specific building. With skills I'll learn
            in Python and basic front end development, I'm excited to bring the site
            to life by the end of the summer.<strong> This will turn into a card that links you to lower on the page.</strong></p>

        <p>I'm Leyla. I have an extensive
            background in lots of fascinating jobs. I've worked as a professional
            rock cellist, I've been
            a flying trapeze instructor, and one of my favorite jobs was working
            as a haunted house clown.</p>
